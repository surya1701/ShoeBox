## Introduction
Fashion is indeed one of the things that people give value to and put effort on. It has become a part of the modern culture and lifestyle. There have been waves of fashion trends but shoes have always been a constant. May it be the brand, the athlete that wears it, the celebrity that owns it or even the nostalgic side of it. Recent years have seen shoes become a collective with the interest in brands at a peak.

ShoeBox will give sneakerheads add a social media experience to buying shoes. A user can stay up-to-date on new releases from the brands they follow, collectives and special editions on our web app.
