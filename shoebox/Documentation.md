## Introduction
Fashion is indeed one of the things that people give value to and put effort on. It has become a part of the modern culture and lifestyle. There have been waves of fashion trends but shoes have always been a constant. May it be the brand, the athlete that wears it, the celebrity that owns it or even the nostalgic side of it. Recent years have seen shoes become a collective with the interest in brands at a peak.

ShoeBox will give sneakerheads add a social media experience to buying shoes. A user can stay up-to-date on new releases from the brands they follow, collectives and special editions on our web app.

## Installation
After [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repo.
```console
foo@bar:~$ cd shoebox
foo@bar:~$ npm i
foo@bar:~$ npm start
```

## Code Snippets
The Home Page contains a carousel component and several item display components. Each item display, on click, opens a sidebar where all images of the shoes can be viewed. Here the images can be zoomed into and after choosing the size, one can add it to cart. Other compenents for different filtered views of shoes (eg. gender, brand) are also in the home page.

The Cart icon and the item counter in the navbar is accompanied by the logo and a search bar. The icon leads to the cart page, which displays all added items with sizes and buttons to increase count, decrease count or remove item from cart. A part of this page shows the number of items and the total cost of the cart.

The checkout buttons redirects users to the payment page. Here the delivery information and payment details are to be provided. Once the form is submitted, the application returns a payment confirmation page.
